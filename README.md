Hi, what this program is supposed to do is make it less of a pain to change where the costume mods for smash bros. characters get assigned to.

I wouldn't call it complete since there are still some stuff to add and modify like making it so that it changes the json file or add support for more sound mods, but since I think this can help some people imma just release it.
